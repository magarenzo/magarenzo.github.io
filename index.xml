      <description>This is the beginnings of my website&amp;rsquo;s migration back to Hugo to start up my blog again. Hugo is &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites&amp;rdquo;, which is great because I often (mercilessly) rebuild pages over and over again, even after the tiniest of changes, to confirm that I like the way they look.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, my name is Michael A. Agarenzo, and I am a Software Engineer.</description>
