## Projects ##

[My Website](https://github.com/magarenzo/magarenzo.github.io)

**DroidTooth File Transfer**  
Senior seminar project.  
*CSS, HTML, Java, Javascript*

**Abstract:**  
*Suppose that you have to present your final project in an hour, but you left a file on your home desktop, which has terrible internet connectivity. However, you realize that a spare Android device is sitting at home and that it is Bluetooth enabled. Can you use your current smart phone to connect to your device at home, and grab your file in a 3-way file transfer?*

*We developed a 3-way file transfer system that allows users to use an Android device or any web browser to connect to an Android device at home and then use the home device to access files from a nearby computer via Bluetooth. Once the home device receives the requested file, it uses cloud storage to send the requested file back to the user.*
