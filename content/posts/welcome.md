This is the beginnings of my website's migration back to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to start up my blog again. Hugo is *"the world's fastest framework for building websites"*, which is great because I often (mercilessly) rebuild pages over and over again, even after the tiniest of changes, to confirm that I like the way they look.

If you don't know yet, **my name is Michael A. Agarenzo, and I am a Software Engineer**. This blog will serve as a way to

1) share some of my experiences, ideas, and projects, and

2) simply learn more about me.

When I had my own domain name, I used to constantly go back and forth between different ways to host my website. At some point in time, it was a:

* Custom static site - *fun, good way to learn basic structure of a small, static website*

* WordPress site - *way too heavy for my needs, but good for when I thought I wanted to be solely a Front End Web Developer*

* Jekyll blog - *oof*

<div style="color: yellow; background-color: black; padding-left: 1em;">And then poof, it was gone when I decided to ditch the domain and server and go in the dark.</div>

...

But now I'm back via hosting this site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! I loosely<sup>1</sup> followed Hugo's [Host on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) article and <span style="color: red">boom</span>, here we are. I plan on this one sticking around for a while.

Now that you're here and have gotten this far, I think the best thing for me to do is to direct you to the static content on this site so you can start to get to know me better until I start pumping out some more blog posts. So without further ado, here is me:

* [About Me, My Skills and Education](https://magarenzo.github.io/about)

* [Projects and Work Experience](https://magarenzo.github.io/work)

* [Volunteer Involvement and Leadership Experience](https://magarenzo.github.io/more)

Lastly, feel free to reach out to me using my [contact](https://magarenzo.github.io/contact) page.

And that's all for now! Thank you for visiting, enjoy your stay, and I hope you come back real soon.

Best,  
Mike

P.S. I'll try to get a subscribe widget up *sooner* rather than *later*.

<sup>1</sup> - *Loosely* because I barely followed it. I read it enough to remember that when you deploy Hugo to production, a public directory is spit out with all of the static content needed for the site to function. I host my development repository privately and when I'm ready to deploy new content, I run `hugo` and push the public directory to my [magarenzo.github.io](https://github.com/magarenzo/magarenzo.github.io) repository and I'm good to go.
