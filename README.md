Source for my current static website hosted at [magarenzo.com](https://magarenzo.com)

---

## Created With

* [`Bootstrap`](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/)

## Development

I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to serve my website for local development. I use the command `http-server -a localhost -p 80` so that I can access my homepage directly at `localhost/index.html` through my web browser.

## TODO

* Desktop - On smaller windows, mobile menu doesn't dissapear on click

* Desktop - Changing window size while using mobile menu breaks menu in different ways
